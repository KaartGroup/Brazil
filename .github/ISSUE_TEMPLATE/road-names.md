about: Template for Road Name Projects

### Scope of Work
To update and add road names to roads that have the data available via the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).

## Strategy
By following the data provided in JOSM via the IBGE imagery layers available, we will be adding street names wherever they are available city by city. The project will begin first in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, after which we will review every available city in Brazil to ensure that as many road names as are available through the IBGE data are all input into OSM.

During this process, we will also verify road geometry utilizing satellite imagery along with the data available via the IBGE layers.
